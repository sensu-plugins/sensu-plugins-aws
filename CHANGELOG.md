## [1.0.0] - 2015-07-22

WARNING:  This release contains major breaking changes that will impact all users.  The flags used for access key and secret key have been standardized accross all plugins resulting in changed flags for the majority of plugins. The new flags are -a AWS_ACCESS_KEY and -k AWS_SECRET_KEY.

### Added
- EC2 node handler will now remove nodes terminated by a user
- Transitioned EC2 node handler from fog to aws sdk v2
- Allowed ignoring nil values returned from Cloudwatch in the check-rds plugin. Previously if Cloudwatch fell behind you would be alerted
- Added support for checking multiple ELB instances at once by passing a comma separated list of ELB instance names in metrics-elb-full.rb
- Added check-autoscaling-cpucredits.rb for checking T2 instances in autoscaling groups that are running low on CPU credits
- Updated the fog and aws-sdk gems to the latest versions to improve performance, reduce 3rd party gem dependencies, and add support for newer AWS features.
- Add metrics-ec2-filter to store node ids and count matching a given filter

### Fixed
- Renamed autoscaling-instance-count-metrics.rb -> metrics-autoscaling-instance-count.rb to match our naming scheme
- Reworked check-rds-events.rb to avoid the ABCSize warning from rubocop
- Corrected the list of plugins / files in the readme
- Make ELB name a required flag for the metrics ELB plugins to prevent nil class errors when it isn't provided
- Properly document that all plugins default to us-east-1 unless the region flag is passed
- Fix the ELB metrics plugins to properly use the passed auth data
- Fixed the metrics-elb-full plugin to still add the ELB instance name when a graphite schema is appended
- Fixed all plugins to support passing the AWS access and secret keys from shell variables. Plugin help listed this as an option for all plugins, but the support wasn't actually there.

## [0.0.4] - 2015-07-05
### Added
- Added the ability to alert on un-snapshotted ebs volumes

## [0.0.3] - 2015-06-26
### Fixed

- Added 3XX metric collection to the ELB metrics plugins
- Fixed the metric type for SurgeQueueLength ELB metrics
- Fixed logic for ec2 instance event inclusion

## [0.0.2] - 2015-06-02
